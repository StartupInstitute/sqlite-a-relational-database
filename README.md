#SQLite a Relational Database
>*To begin you will want to fork a copy of this repository and pull it down to your local machine.*

> This lab may be completed individually, in pairs, or in groups.

###Put Your Knowledge to Practice
#### Relational Database Schemas
> If needed review the [Module One stack](#) from the previous Immersion session. You have been tasked with cloning Twitter.

> 1. Think about the many types of objects/ tables and their relationships.
2. Draw a schema for these relationships.
  - Label the Primary Keys & Foreign Keys
  - Label the relationship between each table.
  - You an complete this using [Google Drawings](drawings.google.com), on a whiteboard, or with pencil and paper.
  - Be sure to save a picture within this repository. *Tip: snap a picture with your phone*.
3. Commit your changes with a brief and meaningful message. 

#### Create a SQLite Database
> Now use your schema to create a SQLite database within this repository.

> 1. Initialize a SQLite database.
2. Create the tables from your schema.
3. Populate the tables with data.
  - Try to challenge yours SQL commands and populate the data with the appropriate joins.
4. Every so often, between table creations perhaps, make sure to commit your changes with a brief and meaningful message.
5. Push up the changes to **your forked version of the repository**.

#### An Important Note
> Creating a SQL database from scratch is meant to be challenging. You may not complete this entire lab. This is okay, as we will review in the debriefing Rails has a powerful tool called ActiveRecord. Understanding the underling pinnings of a database will help you to appreciate the benefits of ActiveRecord and Rails scaffolding.

> Donâ€™t be discouraged. It is more important you practice with the resources from [SQL Course](http://www.sqlcourse.com/), [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql), and [Learn SQL the Hard Way](http://sql.learncodethehardway.org/book/).
